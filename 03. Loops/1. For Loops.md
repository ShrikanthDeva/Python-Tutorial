# For Loops

Used to to execute a block of code for each item in a sequence

### Syntax 
  ```.py
    for iterator in iterable:
       # block of code here
  ```
  + Eg - 
    ```.py
      for i in range(5):
          print("HELLO WORLD!")
    ```
  + O/P -
    ```.py
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
    ``` 
---

### NOTE 

  + range(i,j,k) : Generates a sequence of numbers from i to j with step value k.
  + if i is not given it starts from 0.
  + if k not given it takes the step value as 1.

  + To iterate thriugh  a sequence and skip a particular item, ```if condition ``` can be used.
  + Eg - 
    ```.py
      for i in range(5):
        if (i==3):
            break
        print("HELLO WORLD!")
    ```
  + O/P -
    ```.py
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
      HELLO WORLD!
    ```
---

### THE FOR -ELSE Statement
Syntax 
  ```.py
    for iterator in iterable:
        if condition:
            # a block of code
            break
        # another block of code
    else:
        # This block is executed when 'for loop' terminates completely without breaking out of the loop in between
   ```
