# Variables

+ A variable has a name and stores a value , When the name is called or used it replaces the name with the value given.
+ Eg -
  ```.py
    no_of_apples = 10
    each_apple_cost = 15
    total_cost  = no_of_apples * each_apple_cost
    print( total_cost )
  ```
 + O/P -
    ```.py
       150
    ```
 + Valid Variable name
   + Should start with a charachter or underscore not  numeric values, However it can contain the numbers in any other position.
   + Upper and Lower case letters are treated differently.
   + It cannot be a keyword
 + Shortcut Operator
    + ```x += y``` is logically equivalent to ```x = x + y```
    + ```x *= y``` is logically equivalent to ```x = x * y```
    + So on for all operations
