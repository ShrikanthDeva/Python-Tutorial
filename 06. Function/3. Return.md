# Return


+ A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result.
+ The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned. 
+ Eg- 
 ```.py
  def add5(num):
    if num == 5:
        return 5
    return num+5

  print(add5(10))
  print(add5(5))
 ```
 
 + O/P-
  ```.py
  15
  5
