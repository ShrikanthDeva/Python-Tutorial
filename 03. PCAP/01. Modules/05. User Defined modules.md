# User-defined Modules
+ You can also create your own modules.
+ If you've created many modules, you can even group modules together into a package.
+ Contents of a module file gets implicitly executed by Python when we import the file.
+ Eg -
    ``` module.py ```
    ```.py
        print("Hey! Hope you're doing good.")
    ```

    ```main.py```
    ```.py
        import module
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        Hey! Hope you're doing good.
    ```
+ The initalization of the module only happens once!

## __ __name__ __ variable
+ When you create a module, Python initializes some extra values. One of them is a variable called __ __name__ __.
+ The value of the variable is dependent on how the file is run.
+ Eg -
    ``` module.py ```
    ```.py
        print(__name__)   
        if __name__ == "__main__":
        print("I am not in a module")
    ```

    ```main.py ```
    ```.py
        import module
    ```

+ If you run module.py directly, you'll see it prints main.
+ If you run main.py (importing the module.py file), you'll see that it's value is the name of the module.
+ The entities inside a module can be accessed using the dot notation
+ Eg - 
    ```module.py```
    ```.py
        secret_number = 5
    ```

    ```main.py```
    ```.py
        import module
        print(module.secret_number)
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        5
    ```
+ when you don't want to expose some values within a module, you'll have to follow a convention by preceeding the variable name with one or two underscores as Python has no way to hide module content from users unfortunately.
+ It means the value is a private member.
+ Eg -
    ```module.py```
    ```.py
        #!/usr/bin/env python3 

        """ module.py - an example of Python module """

        __secretNumber = 2

        def get_sum(lst):
            Sum = 0
            for i in lst:
                Sum += (i - __secretNumber)
            return Sum

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print("I run on my own!")
    ```
    
+ On the first line, starting with a hashbang(or a shebang) is used to tell Unix and Unix-like operating system, how to execute contents of the file.
+ Next, you see a line explaining the purpose and contents of the module. It is usually called a doscstring.
+ Then, you see functions defined inside the module that can be imported.
+ The if block in the end executes in case the file is run standalone.
+ You can import the module and use its contents in a main file.
+ ```main.py```
    ```.py
        import module
        lst = [4, 10, 18, 50]
        module.get_sum(lst)
    ```
