# Modules
+ A module is a file containing Python definitons and statements, which can be imported and used when necessary.
+ They allow you to split your codebase into smaller parts.
+ Types of Modules - 
    + User Defined module
    + Built-in modules in Python
    + Other Module that's written by someone else

## Accessing Modules

+ In order to access the contents of the modules you need to import them using the ```import``` keyword.
+ Eg - 
    ```.py
        import math, sys
        print(math.sin(90))
    ```
+ By giving the import keyword followed by the module name you want to import at the top (Import statements are always kept at top ) ,You can now use all the functions that are available inside them.
+ You can import multiple modules by importing them in comma seperated form.
+ Inoder to import a specific function from a specific module you do it as given below 
+ Eg -
    ```.py
        from math import sin as s, cos as c

        print(s(90))
        print(c(90))
    ```
+ O/P -    
    ```.py
       0.8939966636005579 
       -0.44807361612
    ```

+ Here we have imported sin and cos function alone from math module and named them as s and c respectively using ```as``` keyword.

### Note:
+ Importing certain function alone from a module may cause ***Naming conflicts *** , if theres already a user defined function with same name.
+ You can import all function using the below command too 
    ```.py
        from math import *

        print(sin(90))
    ```
