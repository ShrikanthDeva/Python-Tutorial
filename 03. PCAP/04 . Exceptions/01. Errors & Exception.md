# Errors and Exceptions 
+ Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution.
+ Exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. 
+ Two types of Error occurs in python. 
    + Syntax errors
    + Logical errors (Exceptions) 

## Syntax Error
+ Eg - 
    ```.py
        if (10>10)    
            print("weird")
        else
            print("cool")
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    ```
+ Error due to missing of ```:``` in if anf else statements


## Logical Error
+ Eg - 
    ```.py
        let_a_be = 10000
        let_ans_be = let_a_be / 0
        print(let_ans_be)
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    ```
+ Error due to Dividing by zero

## Handling exceptions
+ You can handle the exceptions that may or may not occur during the execution of your program using the ```try``` and ```except block```.
+ The code block in ```try``` executes like a normal code. If an exception arises, it checks for ```except``` blocks
+ Eg -
    ```.py
    try :
        x = int(input("Enter a number : "))
        y = 1/x
        print(y)
    except ZeroDivisionError :
        print("You cannot divide by zero !")
    except ValueError :
        print("Please enter an integer !")
    except :
        print("Something else went wrong ")
    finally:
        print("All done!")
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        Enter a number : 0
        You cannot divide by zero !
        All done!
    ```
