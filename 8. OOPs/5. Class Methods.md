## CSV FILES

+ When we are doing bigger projects we might have hard time in debugging if all the instances and the main code are maintained in the same python file.
+ Inorder to solve this problem we can use ```.csv``` files to read all the data of the instances from it.
+ ***CSV*** Refers to Comma Sperated Values, basically we store our instances data in comma seperated form.
+ ***CSV*** is a great option because it allows the data to be saved in a table structured format.

### Content Stored in items.csv
```.py
  name,price,quantity
  "Noodles",15,10
  "Chocolate",5,12
  "Biryani",100,3
  "Pulaav",70,5
  "Naan",25,8 
```
+ The first line represents the columns that we are going to have for the data we are going to maintain.


## Reading data from csv file

+ Inorder to read the csv file we need to create a method inside our class but for calling a method which is inside the class we an instance but our instances are yet to be instaniated with the ```items.csv``` file.                        
+ To solve this problem we change the method to a class method using the ***DECORATOR*** -> ```@classmethod```.
+ ***Decorators*** in Python is just a quick way to change the behaviour of the functions what we write by basically calling them just before the line that we create our function.                
+ NOTE : 
  + An object can also access the class attributes and the class methods.
```.py
  # Contd..
    def apply_discount(self):
            self.price -= self.price * self.discount 

    @classmethod
    def instantiate(cls):
        with open("items.csv", "r") as f:
            reader = csv.DictReader(f)
            items = list(reader)

        for item in items:
            Item(
                  name = item.get('name'),
                  price = float(item.get('price')),
                  quantity = int(item.get('quantity'))
                )
            
            

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(\"{self.name}\", {self.price}, {self.quantity})"

  Item.instantiate()
```

+ We open our csv file using a context manager which is:
```.py
  with open("items.csv", "r") as f:
```
+ Under this block, we use the method to directly read the CSV file which converts the contents into a dictionary object. To use this method, we need to ```import``` the csv library.     
```.py
   reader = csv.DictReader(f)
```
+ Now, for each item in the list, we created an instance by calling the default constructor.
```.py
   Item(
            name = item.get('name'),
            price = float(item.get('price')),
            quantity = int(item.get('quantity'))
       )
```     
+ To read the data from the dictionary object, we convert it into a list and iterate over the list with the help of a for-loop.
```.py
  items = list(reader)
  for item in items:
      print(item)
```
> O/P - 
```.py
  OrderedDict([('name', 'Noodles'), ('price', '15'), ('quantity', '10')])
  OrderedDict([('name', 'Chocolate'), ('price', '5'), ('quantity', '12')])
  OrderedDict([('name', 'Biryani'), ('price', '100'), ('quantity', '3')])
  OrderedDict([('name', 'Pulaav'), ('price', '70'), ('quantity', '5')])
  OrderedDict([('name', 'Naan'), ('price', '25'), ('quantity', '8')])
```
+ NOTE : 
  + When reading from csv files, Python stores the content as strings .
  + Since, we expect price to be a float and quantity to be an integer, we convert them.
