# Constructors

+ The constructor is a method that is called when an object is created. This method is defined in the class and can be used to initialize basic variables.
+ If you create four objects, the class constructor is called four times. Every class has a constructor, but its not required to explicitly define it.
+ Syntax - 
  ```.py
    class class_name :
    def __init__(self):
        print("The constructor has been invoked!")
    

    obj = class_name()
  ```
+ When a object is created the constructor is invoked automatically, And then the actions within the __init()__ method is executed.
+ Using Constructor we can pass the attributes of the object in parameters, and assign them using ```self.attribute_name```.
+ Eg -
  ```.py
    class Item:
    def __init__(self, name : str, price : float , quantity : int):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity
    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity

    item1 = Item("Noodles", 8, 5)
    item2 = Item("Chocolate", 4, 11)

    print(item1.name , item1.price, item1.quantity )
    print(item2.name , item2.price, item2.quantity )
  ```
+ In the above example , using constructor we have passed the  ```name```,```price```,```quantity``` of the object we have created and assigned to the respective attributes.
+ Also, we have used same technique for ```calculate_total_price()``` method as self is passed as first parameter.
+ We can also specify the type of parameter as done above.
+ You can also give default values for the parameters like ``` quantity = 0 ```.
