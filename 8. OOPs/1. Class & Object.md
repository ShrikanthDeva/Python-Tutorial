# Classes & Objects

+ In Python each data type is an intantited object of in-built classes.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
    >>> print( type( "Some String" ) )
    >>> print( type( 7 ) )
  ```
+ O/P -
  ```.py
    <class 'str' >
    <class 'int' >
  ```
  
## Creating Class

+ A new class can be created with ``` class ``` keyword followed by the name of the class.
+ Sytanx -
  ```.py
    class item :
            pass            
  ```
+ The ``` pass ``` keyword is given so that python won't throw an error when a object is created.
+ It is usually given when you want to create a class without difining what it does.

### Intitalising An Object

+ You can create an object of the class using the following
+ Syntax - 
  ```.py
    obj = item()
  ```
+ Now, we have intantited an object ``` obj ``` of the class ``` no_use ```.
+ We can assign some attributes to the object we have created using ``` . ``` operator.
  ```.py
    obj.name = "Desktop"
    obj.price = 70000
    obj.quantity = 10
  ```
## Creating Methods

+ Methods are similar to functions which can be used for the instances of the object.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
    class item :
      def calculate_total_price(self):
        pass
  ```
+ When we use a method on an object, Python automatically passes the object itself as the first parameter.
+ So, while creating methods inside classes, it is necessary to have a parameter called `self`, so that when using the method with an instance, Python can pass the instance itself as the parameter.
+ `self` stands for passing the object it*self*, as a parameter.
+ You can give any name to the paramater, but calling it `self` is the common convention.   

### Sample Program
```.py
  class Item:
    def calculate_total_price(self, x, y):
        return x * y
  item1 = Item()
  item1.name = "Laptop"
  item1.price = 70000
  item1.quantity = 7
  print(item1.calculate_total_price(item1.price, item1.quantity))

  item2 = Item()
  item2.name = "CPU"
  item2.price = 8000
  item2.quantity = 8
  print(item2.calculate_total_price(item2.price, item2.quantity))
```
+ O/P - 
  >490000
  
  >64000
