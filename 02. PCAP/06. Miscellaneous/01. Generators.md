# Generators
+ Generators are specialized code that's able to return a series of values, and to control the iteration process.
+ It is generally invoked more than once
### Iterator 
+ An iterator is a data type that implements the iterator protocol.
+ ```__iter__()``` -> Returns the object
+ ```__next__()``` -> Returns the next value of the series of values
+ Eg -
   + ```range()``` function is a built-in generator.You can also create your own generator.
### yield 

+ The yield keyword freezes the value until the next invocation.
+ Eg -
  ```.py
    for i in range(5):
      yield 5
  ```
+ O/P -
  ```.py
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
  ```
