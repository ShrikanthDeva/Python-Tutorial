# Files and I/O Operations
+ In python you don't directly work with files. Instead, you work with stream.
+ Stream consists of certain methods in order to perform certain actions that affect the real file.
+ Actions performed in Stream 
  + open : connects to a stream in order to open a file in 
  + (for text files)
    + read mode (r),
    + write mode (w),
    + read and update mode (r+)
    + write and update mode (w+)
    + append mode (a)
  + (for binary files)
    + read mode (rb),
    + write mode (wb),
    + read and update mode (r+b)
    + write and update mode (w+b)
    + append mode (ab)

  +  ```.py 
      stream = open("path/to/file", "r")
     ```
  + close : closes the connection to the stream  
  +  ```.py
      stream = open("path/to/file", "r")
      stream.close()
     ```
## Types of Stream :
+ Text Stream : A sequence of typographical characters (letters, digits, etc)
+ Binary Stream : A sequence of bytes
+ When you run your program, three streams are automatically opened
+ ```sys.stdin``` Responsible for reading data by the running program.
+ ```sys.stdout``` Responsible for outputting data by the running program.
+ ```sys.sterr``` Responsible for errors raised by the running program
+ These are available in system module.

## Read from a file
+ read() 
  ```.py
    from os import strerror

    try :
        stream = open('text.txt', "rt")
        character = stream.read(1)
        while character != '':
            print(character, end ='\n')
            character = stream.read(1)
        stream.close()

    except IOError as e:
        print("I/O error occured: ", strerror(e.errno))
  ```
### bytearray 
+ Specialized class to handle amorpous data
  ```.py
    data = bytearray(5)
    print(data)
  ```
+ O/P -
  ```.py
    bytearray(b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')
  ```
