# OOPs Vs Procedural

+ In python there are 2 ways to approach and organise our program. They are -
    + Procedural
    + Object-oriented

## Procedural
+ It distinguishes data or variables and code( modules and functions).
+ Fuctions can use the data but the data cannot use the function.
+ Data can however use the methods , they can be invoked within this data.

+ Eg - 
    ```.py
        stack =[]
        def push(val):
            stack.append(val) 
        def pop():
            val = stack[-1]
            del stack[-1]
            return val

        push(2)
        push(3)
        push(4)
        print(stack)
        print(pop()
        print(pop())
        print(stack)
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        [2,3,4]
        4
        3
        [2]
    ```
+ The problem here is any one can access the stack and modify it.       
    


## Object-oriented
+ Data and the code are enclosed together divided into classes.
+ Objects exchange data and activate thier methods.
+ They can protect sensible data in order to protect unauthoraised modification.
+ OOPs helps in - 
    + ***Introspection***
        + The ability of the program to examine the type and properties of an object at run time.
    + ***Reflection***
        + The ability of the program to manipulate the values, properties and methods of an object at run time.
        
+ Eg of classes and sub-classes-
    + VEHILES ( Super class)
        + Land (sub class of vehicle / parent class of the below)
            + Wheeled
            + Tracked
            + Hovercrafts
        + Water (sub class of vehicle / parent class of the below)
            + Boat
            + Ship
        + Air (sub class of vehicle / parent class of the below)
            + Helicopter
            + Boeing 747
        + Space (sub class of vehicle / parent class of the below)
            + Rocket

+ ```Wheeled``` sub-class has all the property of ```Land``` sub-class as well as ```VEHILES``` class. Similarly all the sub-classes can access their parent classes.

+ Eg - 
    ```.py
        class stack:
            def __init(self):
                self.__Stack_list = []
            def push(self,val):
                self.__Stack_list.append(val)
            def pop(self):
                val = self.__Stack_list[-1]
                del self.__Stack_list[-1]
                return val
            def print_stack(self):
                print(self.__Stack_list)

        stack_obj = stack()
        stack_obj.push(2)
        stack_obj.push(3)
        stack_obj.push(4)
        stack_obj.print_stack()
        print(stack_obj.pop())
        print(stack_obj.pop())
        stack_obj.print_stack()
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        [2,3,4]
        4
        3
        [2]
    ```

+ Now our stack is proctected as we have given ```__Stack_list```. You will learn lot about this in the up coming notes.
