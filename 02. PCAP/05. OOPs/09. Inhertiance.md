# Inhertiance

+ A class which inherits all the attributes and functionalities from the parent class is called Inheritance.
+ Class that you inherit from, is called a ```parent class```.
+ Multiple classes that inherits from that parent class, are called ```child classes```.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
     class Animal:
     pass

     class Dog(Animal):
         pass
     
     class Cat(Animal):
         pass
  ```
+ Whenever an object of child class is created, the constructor of child class is invoked automatically if it exists. If not, the constructor of parent class is called.
+ Inorder to use both the Constructors you can use ```Super``` keyword.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
    class Animal:
      def __init__():
          print("Parent class constructor invoked!")

    class Dog(Animal):
        def __init__():
            super.__init__();
            print("Child class constructor invoked!")
            
    German_Shepherd = Dog()
  ```
+ O/P -
  ```.py
    Parent class constructor invoked!
    Child class constructor invoked! 
  ```
+ NOTE - 
  + If your parent constructor requires some parameter to be passed for , you can use the below command while calling the ```super``` keyword.
  ```.py
    super().__init__(parameter 1 ,parameter 2, ... )
  ```  
## Method overriding
+ If there is a method with the same name in a child class as well as the parent class, by default, the method in the child class only will be invoked.
+ If you need to invoke the method of the parent class, with an existing method with the same name in the child class. 
+ You can do so:
    + with the name of the class followed by the dot operator and then the name of the method.
    + But here you need to pass in self as a mandatory parameter, while calling the method because we call the method from the class level.
```
A().method1(self)
```
+ Or using the super() function, which is the preferred method
```
super().method1()
```
+ Eg -
  ```.py
      class A:
          def method1(self):
              return "Hi from class A"

      class B(A):
          def method1(self):
              return "Hi from class B"
          def method2(self):
              # Accessing method1 from child class calls the child class's method only
              return self.method1()
          def method3(self):
              # Using super() we can access the parent class's method1
              return super().method1()
          

      a = A()
      b = B()

      print(a.method1())
      print(b.method1())
      print()

      print(b.method2()) 
      print(b.method3())
  ```
+ O/P - 
  ```.py
    Hi from class A
    Hi from class B

    Hi from class B
    Hi from class A
  ```
