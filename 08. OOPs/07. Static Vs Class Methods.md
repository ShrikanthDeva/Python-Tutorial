# Static Vs Class Methods

## When do we use a static method?
+ We use a static method when we want to do something that should not be unique per instance. Exactly like we did above.
+ We could use the static method as an isolated function. That is also completely fine but we prefer to not do that because, although it is a method that had nothing to do with the instance, it is somehow related to the class.

## When do we use a class method?
+ We create a class method for instantiating instances from some structured data.
+ Class methods are used to manipulate different structures of data to instantiate objects, like we did previously with the csv file.
+ static methods do not pass the object reference as the first argument in the backgeound. Whereas, in ***class methods*** the object reference is a ***mandatory parameter*** we should receive in order for it to work.
