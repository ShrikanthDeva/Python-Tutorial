# Nested Lists

### Matrix - 2D

+ A 2-Dimentional array or list is called as a 2D-Matrix.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
      l = [ [1,2,3],
            [4,5,6],
            [7,8,9]
          ]
  ```
  
+ #### Accessing Elements
  +  list_name[ ```ith row```] [ ```jth column``` ]
  +  Say you want to ```8``` from the above example your code should look like
  +  ```.py
      print(l[2][1])
     ``` 
  + As  ```8``` is present in 2nd row 1st column.


### CUBE - 3D

+ A 3-Dimentional array or list is called as a 3D-Cube.
+ Eg - 
  ```.py
      l = [  [  [1,2,3],
                [4,5,6],
                [7,8,9]
             ],
             [  [4,5,6]
                [1,2,3],
                [7,8,9]
             ]
          ]
  ```
  
+ #### Accessing Elements
  +  list_name[```xth 2-D array```][ ```xth 2-D array ith row```] [ ```xth 2-D array jth column``` ]
  +  ```.py
      print(l[1][1][0])
     ``` 
  + O/P
    ```.py
