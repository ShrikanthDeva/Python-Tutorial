# Finding in List

You can find whether an element is present in the the list or not using ```in``` and ```not in``` keywords.
+ Eg - 
    ```.py
      
      l = ["a","b","c","d","e"]
      if b in l:
        print("YES 'b' IS THERE")
      else:
        print("NO 'b' IS NOT THERE")
      if z not in l:
        print("NO 'z' IS NOT THERE")
      else:
        print("YES 'z' IS  THERE")
    ```
+ O/P -
    ```.py
        YES 'b' IS THERE
        NO 'Z' IS NOT THERE
    ```
