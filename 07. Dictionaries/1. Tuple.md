# Tuple

Tuple is a collection of items which are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

### Syntax 
  ```.py
    t = ("elements","seprated","in", "comma")
    
  ```
  + Eg - 
    ```.py
      t = (1,2,3,4,5)
      n = ("a","b","c")
    ```
---
### Acessing Elements
 
+ You can access elements of the tuple with their index.
+ Index of the tuple starts from ```0``` and goes on till ```length-1```.
+ Negative indexing Starts from ```-length``` to ```-1```.
  + Eg - 
    ```.py
      #INDEX   0    1   2   3   4
      >>> t = ("a","b","c","d","e")
      #INDEX   -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
      >>> print(t[1])
      >>> print(t[-2])      
    ```
  + O/P -
    ```.py
      >>> b
      >>> c      
    ``` 
    
### Slicing Tuple

You can slice a tuple with the following sytanx
+ ```.py
    tuple_name[start:end:step_value]

+ This slices the tuple from ```start``` value till ```end-1``` value with a step count of ```step_value```.
+ If ```start``` is not specified it starts from ```0``` th index.
+ If ```end``` is not specified it slices till ```length-1``` index.
+ If ```step_value``` is not specified it steps ```1```.
+ You can use Negative index too.

### Updating Tuple

+ Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.
+ But there are some workarounds.
+ Eg- 
  ```.py
    t = ("a","b","c","d","e")
    l = list(t)
    l[1] = "OMG"
    t = tuple(l)
    print(t)
  ```
+ O/P -
  ```.py
    ('a', 'OMG', 'c', 'd', 'e') 
  ```

### NOTE:
+ Tuple can have elements of any type
+ Eg -
  ```.py
    t = (1, "String", age, (1,2))
+ You can create a tuple by giving comma next to the elements
+ Eg -
  ```.py
    t1 = 1,
    t2 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    print(t1)
    print(t2)
+ O/P - 
  ```.py
    (1,)
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
