# Array Of Objects

+ We can store all the objects or instances we have created of a particular class using the concept of array of objects.
+ We basically create the an array as a class attribute and we keep appending the objects when the contructor method is called, just like normal list appending.
+ Eg- 
  ```.py
    class Item:
    discount = 0.2 # 20% Discount
    array_obj = []     # Array of objects
    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float, quantity=0):
        # Run validations to received arguments
        assert price >= 0, "Price cannot be negative!"
        assert quantity >= 0, "Quantity cannot be negative!"

        # Assign to self object    
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity

        Item.array_obj.append(self) # Appending the object itself to the array
        
    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity
    def apply_discount(self):
        self.price -= self.price * self.discount # Class Attribute
    def __repr__(self):
    return f"{self.__class__.__name__}(\"{self.name}\", {self.price}, {self.quantity})"
    
    item1 = Item("Noodles", 100, 5)
    item2 = Item("Biryani", 1000, 1)
    item3 = Item("Chocolate", 50, 8)
    
    print(Item.array_obj)
  ```
+ You could see that we have used a ***MAGIC METHOD*** ```__repr__``` which stands for representation, it basically changes the way an object or intance is being represented.
+ You can return anything with this method, but we returned a formatted string with the attributes which would make the array of objects more readable.
+ Without defining ```__repr__``` method also you can get the list of items  but it wont be user friendly.
+ O/P-
  ```.py
    [
      Item("Noodles", 100, 5),
      Item("Biryani", 1000, 1),
      Item("Chocolate", 50, 8)
    ]
  ```
+ NOTE : ```self.__class__.__name__``` returns the name of the class of which the object was created.
