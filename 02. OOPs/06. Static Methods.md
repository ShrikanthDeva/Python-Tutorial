# Static Methods

+ A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. A static method can't access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
+ We use the ***DECORATOR*** ```@staticmethod``` to create the static method.
+ Static methods don't pass the object itself as the first argument. This is because, it is just like a regular function as they don't take instance as a parameter by default.
+ For example we will create a static method for checking if a entered float number is an integer too.
+ EG -
  ```.py
        @staticmethod 
    def is_integer(num):
        # Checks if the floats are point zero
        # Ex: 5.0, 12.0
        if isinstance(num, float):
            return num.is_integer()
        elif isinstance(num, int):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    print(Item.is_integer(7))
    print(Item.is_integer(7.5))
    print(Item.is_integer(7.0))
  ```
+ O/P - 
  ```.py
    True
    False
    True
  ```  
+ ```isinstance(object, class)``` is an in-built Python function to check is the specified object is an instance of the particular class.  
+ NOTE : A static method can also be accessed from the instance level.
