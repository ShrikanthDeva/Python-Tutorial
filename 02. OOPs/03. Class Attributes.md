# Class Attributes
  
+ A Class Attribute is an attribute that belongs to the class itself but can also be accessed from instance level
+ From the previous example - 
  ```.py
    class Item:
    discount = 0.2 # 20% Discount -> Class Attribute
    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float, quantity=0):
        # Run validations to received arguments
        assert price >= 0, "Price cannot be negative!"
        assert quantity >= 0, "Quantity cannot be negative!"

        # Assign to self object    
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity
    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity

    item1 = Item("Noodles", 8, 5)
    item2 = Item("Chocolate", 4, 11)

    print(Item.discount)    # Accessible in class level
    print(item1.discount)   # Accessible in instance level aswell
    print(item2.discount)
  ```
+ When we try to acccess the class attribute from an instance , first it checks in the instance level, and it realises that the specified attribute is not an instance level attribute, so it starts checking at class level.         
+ There is a magic attribute in Python that displays all the attributes of that specific object, (i.e) the ```__dict__``` attribute which returns all the attributes of that class or that instance as key:value pairs as a dictionary.
+ We can access the class attribute using 2 ways-
  + ```Class_name.attribute_name```
  + ```self.attribute_name```
+ However the ```self.attribute_name``` is the most prefered one because we can change the value of the class attribute for different instances.
+ EG - 
  ```.py
    class Item:
    discount = 0.2 # 20% Discount
    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float, quantity=0):
        # Run validations to received arguments
        assert price >= 0, "Price cannot be negative!"
        assert quantity >= 0, "Quantity cannot be negative!"

        # Assign to self object    
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.quantity = quantity
    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity
    def apply_discount(self):
        self.price -= self.price * self.discount # Class Attribute

    item1 = Item("Noodles", 100, 5)
    item1.apply_discount()
    print(item1.discount,item1.price)

    item2 = Item("Biryani", 1000, 1)
    item2.discount = 0.3
    item2.apply_discount()
    print(item2.discount,item2.price)

  ```
+ O/P -
    >0.2 80.0
    
    >0.3 700.0
  
+ Here we have given our own discount rate ```0.3``` rather than the regular one for the item ```briyani``` ,therefore the total price of the item has changed.
